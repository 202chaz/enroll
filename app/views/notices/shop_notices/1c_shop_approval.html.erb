		Your contribution will remain fixed based on the reference plan.  Employees enrolling in any other available plan will pay the difference in premium to “buy-up” or “buy-down. If you are unable to contribute at least 50% of the cost of single coverage, you will only be able to offer coverage through DC Health Link during special annual enrollment period described above.",

     You must provide your employees with at least 10 days to review their plan options and select which plan they would like to enroll in.  Open Enrollment must end no later than the 10th day of the month prior to your coverage effective date.<br><br>
     At the beginning of Open Enrollment, DC Health Link will send an email to your eligible employees to announce the beginning of their Open Enrollment Period and provide them with instructions on how to create a DC Health Link account and log in, review their plan options, and enroll into coverage.  You will also receive a copy of this open enrollment notice. During Open Enrollment, you can monitor your employee elections and send reminder emails to your eligible employees who have not yet enrolled in a plan.",

       Your coverage will only be finalized upon payment of your first month’s premium.  Payment must be received and cleared no later than the 15th day of the month prior to your coverage effective date.  Payments over the phone are required, as they can be processed immediately and will ensure your coverage will not be delayed.<br><br>
