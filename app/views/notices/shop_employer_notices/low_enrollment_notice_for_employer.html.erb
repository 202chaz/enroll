          <strong><i>Employers should review their roster to ensure that owners and family members of owners ensure that any employees who are also owners (or family members of owners) are identified as owners on their roster.</i></strong> For your group to receive coverage through the Small Business Marketplace, you must have at least one non-owner enrolled in a health plan at the end of each annual employee open enrollment period. 

        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
          <strong>First Month’s Premium Payment</strong><br>Once your open enrollment period ends, you will receive an email from <%= Settings.site.short_name %> listing each of your enrolled employees, their premiums, and the employer/employee cost breakdown. If your first month’s premium is not received and cleared by 5:00 p.m. on < binder_payment_deadline >, your group’s coverage will be delayed and your employees may experience a gap in coverage. Payments over the phone or online are <strong><i>required</i></strong> for your first payment, as they can be processed immediately and will ensure your coverage will not be delayed. Checks are not accepted for the first month of coverage as they cannot be processed in time for your group’s enrollments to be transmitted to your health insurance company.<br></br>
          Once this first premium payment is received, your enrollments will be transmitted to the insurance companies to complete processing and setup of your group and each employee’s enrollments. The insurance companies mail member ID cards to each enrolled employee’s home address on or around the coverage effective date, this usually takes two weeks.<br></br>
          Once your coverage takes effect, you will receive regular monthly invoices from <%= Settings.site.short_name %> through the mail that include each employee’s enrollment, their premium, and the employer/employee cost breakdown. All premium payments will be made directly to <%= Settings.site.short_name %> either online, by phone or by mail.<br></br>
