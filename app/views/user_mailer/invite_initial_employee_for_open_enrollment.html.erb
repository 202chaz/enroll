<div>Dear <%= census_employee.full_name.humanize.titleize %>,</div>
<br/><br/>
<div>
  Good News! <%= census_employee.employer_profile.legal_name %>, has invited you to sign up for employer-sponsored coverage through <%= Settings.site.short_name %> and will contribute to the monthly premium to make the cost of coverage more affordable.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  You are now able to begin plan shopping for coverage effective on <%= census_employee.coverage_effective_on.to_formatted_s %>. In order to enroll into employer-sponsored coverage through <%= Settings.site.short_name %>, you must complete an application for enrollment by <%= census_employee.new_hire_enrollment_period.last.to_date.to_formatted_s %>. If you have other coverage, you will still want to “waive” coverage to preserve your special enrollment period rights for the plan year.

  <br/>
  Open enrollment is your annual opportunity to enroll in health plans offered by your employer. Outside of this annual open enrollment period, you will only be allowed to make changes to your enrollment if you experience certain life events such as marriage, birth, or adoption.
